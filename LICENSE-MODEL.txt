Licenses
The licensor grants you a copyright license to do everything you might do with the model that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it, for any non-commercial purpose.

Non-commercial Purpose
Non-commercial purposes include any of the following uses of the model or its output, but only so far as you do not receive any direct or indirect payment arising from the use of the model or its output.

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance.
Use by commercial or for-profit entities for testing, evaluation, or non-commercial research and development. Use of the model to train other models for commercial use is not a non-commercial purpose.

No Other Rights
These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.

Patent Defense
If you make any written claim that the model infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your licenses for the model granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

Violations
The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the model or its output that is not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 30 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

No Liability
AS FAR AS THE LAW ALLOWS, THE MODEL AND ITS OUTPUT COME AS IS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, AND THE LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE USE OR NATURE OF THE MODEL OR ITS OUTPUT, UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM.
